At least 42 business days are required to set up appointments from the time the application, signed Participation Agreement, payment and marketing materials are received at CS Japan.  Companies are advised to apply for a GKS well in advance as the requested dates may not be available due to prior commitments.  Once the GKS request has been accepted by CS Japan, our specialist in charge of the industry sector will begin to select target companies, contact prospective Japanese companies and send information about your company and product/service in order to gauge the level of interest by the Japanese companies.  Meetings are arranged, based on the level of interest.    Japanese companies like to take time to thoroughly understand the product/service and learn about the U.S, company prior to making a decision about a possible meeting.  There are times when a Japanese company will decide to accept a meeting very close to the time of a U.S. companies' planned arrival in Japan for a GKS.  The specialist will make every effort to ensure that the scheduled meetings are productive.    The average number of meetings per day is three for meetings with companies located in each metropolitan area, due to distances and traffic, but this is subject to change depending on the location of the Japanese companies to be visited and the interest level of the companies in your products or services.    A professional interpreter is generally required.  Japanese companies usually ask a U.S. company to bring an interpreter to the meeting in order for them to avoid misunderstandings; consequently, an interpreter must be hired.  Our CS Japan specialist can escort you and attend the meetings but cannot work as an interpreter since the specialist is attending the meeting in a professional capacity and they will not be effective if they are considered only an interpreter.

GK service includes four to five appointments per day. STANDARD GOLD KEY SERVICE: The price for a Gold Key Service in CS Mexico service areas for SME's (small-medium size enterprises) is USD700 for the first service day.   The Gold Key Service (GKS) in Mexico includes a day-long schedule of vetted appointments. However, it does not include the support of a bilingual trade professional to accompany the client to the appointments, nor the cost for transportation for the client to attend the appointments.    The support of a bilingual trade professional will require the payment of an additional $250.00 per day.  Although the support of a bilingual trade professional is optional, it is CS Mexicoâs experience that the best results for clients are obtained when they choose to utilize the service of one of our bilingual trade professionals when meeting with their Gold Key Service business contacts. This additional service is highly recommended, not only for logistics and language support, but also for relationship-building and real-time counseling during your meetings.    Also, transportation services to support the Gold Key Service require a separate fee, and the cost will depend upon the location of the appointments.    Ultimately, the final decision about whether or not to use trade professional support and/or transportation services during the Gold Key Service is up to the client in consultation with Post and the USEAC.  Additional charges for out of service areas may apply (see expanded service area in Notes).  Additional SME GK days are USD535/day including the mandatory interpreter charge. The additional USD185 interpreter charge also applies to discount engagements (i.e., first time customers). Large firm GKS price is USD2,300 for the first day and USD1,000 for each subsequent day (including interpreter/escort).   Local transportation is arranged and costs varies by location. We ask the client to pay cash to driver.   - NON-STANDARD GKS PRICES/EXPANDED SERVICE AREA: See Notes for pricing outside major cities or to include meetings covering several industry sectors.   RESCHEDULING COST: $200.   It is also strongly advised for security reasons and ease of travel that the U.S. client use the transportation arranged by CS Mexico offices.     CS MEXICO GOLD KEY NOTES   - EXPANDED SERVICE AREA GK: Available at an additional cost in areas outside of the standard CS office coverage (i.e. Cancun, Juarez, Puebla, Hermosillo, and Saltillo). Check with post for availability and cost.  - RESCHEDULING COST: Gold Keys can be rescheduled if the original research was conducted within six months of date of payment and the U.S. client wants the same appointment schedule. Cost for rescheduling appointments if client changes dates is USD200. Beyond six months Gold Keys can be rescheduled for this fee only with the approval of the Trade Specialist or Commercial Officer (some industries change rapidly). Otherwise Gold Key Service fee is non-refundable."
